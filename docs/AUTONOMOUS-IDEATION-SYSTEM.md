## Orchestrator Logic

The Orchestrator (Agent 15) manages the autonomous workflow:

```python
# Pseudo-code for Orchestrator behavior

def autonomous_ideation_pipeline(X):
    approved_ideas = []
    rejected_ideas = []
    iteration = 0

    while len(approved_ideas) < X:
        iteration += 1
        print(f"Starting iteration {iteration}")

        # PHASE 1: Generate ideas
        ideas_batch = []
        ideas_batch += request_ideas(agent_01, count=2-3)
        ideas_batch += request_ideas(agent_02, count=2-3)
        ideas_batch += request_ideas(agent_03, count=2-3)

        # PHASE 2 & 3: Evaluate and vote on each idea
        for idea in ideas_batch:
            print(f"Evaluating: {idea.title}")

            # Parallel evaluation by 6 analysts
            reports = {
                'technical': request_evaluation(agent_04, idea),
                'business': request_evaluation(agent_05, idea),
                'market': request_evaluation(agent_06, idea),

                'competitive': request_evaluation(agent_09, idea)
            }

            # Sequential voting by 5 reviewers
            votes = []
            for reviewer in [agent_10, agent_11, agent_12, agent_13, agent_14]:
                vote = request_vote(reviewer, idea, reports)
                votes.append(vote)

            # Count YES votes
            yes_votes = sum(1 for v in votes if v.decision == 'YES')

            # Decision
            if yes_votes >= 3:
                approved_ideas.append({
                    'idea': idea,
                    'reports': reports,
                    'votes': votes,
                    'score': yes_votes,
                    'iteration': iteration
                })
                print(f"✓ APPROVED ({yes_votes}/5)")
            else:
                rejected_ideas.append({
                    'idea': idea,
                    'votes': votes,
                    'score': yes_votes,
                    'iteration': iteration
                })
                print(f"✗ REJECTED ({yes_votes}/5)")

            # Check if quota reached
            if len(approved_ideas) >= X:
                break

    # Generate final report
    return generate_final_report(approved_ideas, rejected_ideas, iteration)
```
